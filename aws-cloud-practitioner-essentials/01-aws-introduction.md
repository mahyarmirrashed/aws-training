# Module 1: Introduction to Amazon Web Services

## Cloud Computing

- Almost all cloud computing centers around client-server model
- Virtual servers are called Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances
- AWS key model: pay for what you need (no wastage from oversubscriptions)
- Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT
  - Tasks that are common, repetitive, and time-consuming
- Three principle cloud computing deployment models:
  - Cloud-based deployment (all parts of application are within cloud)
  - On-premises deployment (resources deployed using virtualization and resource management tooling)
  - Hybrid deployment (connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure)
- Cloud computing is beneficial for companies who want to save on upfront expenses (e.g. data centers, physical servers, IT setup)
  - Variable expense allows companies to implement solutions while saving on upfront costs
- Cloud computing (especially serverless) provides ability to not focus on managing infrastructure and servers and instead, focus on applications and customers
- Cloud computing allows scaling in/out in response to demand
- Cloud providers and users benefit from massive economies of scale (lower than normally possible pay-as-you-go pricing)
- Rather than waiting weeks to obtain needed resources, cloud computing enables access to new resources within minutes
