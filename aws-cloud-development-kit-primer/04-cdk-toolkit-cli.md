# Module 4: Working with the AWS CDK Toolkit (CLI)

## AWS CDK Toolkit

- CDK Toolkit for creating/running application, interrogating defined application model, and deploying AWS CloudFormation templates generated by CDK
- Deploying CDK applications into AWS account may require provisioning resources ahead of time that CDK needs to correctly perform deployment
- CDK only adds objects to buckets; does not remove objects from bucket nor does it apply a default lifecycle policy
  - Regularly clear out unnecessary objects from S3 buckets (or risk additional charges)
