# Module 1: Introduction to Developer Operations

## What is DevOps?

- DevOps is combination of philosophies, practices, and tools that increase ability ot deliver applications and services quickly
  - Faster pace than traditional software development and infrastructure management processes
- DevOps: Development (Dev) Operations (Ops)
  - Dev: people and processes creating software
  - Ops: teams and processes delivering and monitoring software
- Developers change things quickly, release often, and measure success by rate of delivery
- Operations are driven by maintaining application stability
  - Frequent releases are cause for concern of stability and reliability of applications on supported platforms
- DevOps brings formerly siloed roles (development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security) to optimize productivity of developers and reliability of operations
- Culturally, DevOps is combination of:
  - Philosophies removing barriers and sharing end-to-end responsibility
  - Processes developed for speed and quality to streamline work
  - Tools that align with processes and automating repeatable tasks (making release process more efficient)

## Problems with Traditional Development Practices

- Waterfall development projects are slow, not iterative, resistant to change, and have long release cycles
  - Rigid requirements, set at start, unlikely to change
  - Development phases supported by highly specialized teams
  - Testing and security come after complete implementations (corrective actions are responsive and expensive)
- Monolithic applications are hard to update and deploy 
  - Developed and deployed as unit, entire application must be redeployed
  - Tightly coupled functionality (maintenance becomes an issue because developers have hard time understanding entire application)
  - Implemented using single development stack: changing technolgoy is difficult and costly
- Manual processes are slow, inconsistent, and error-prone

## Why DevOps?

- Organizations of any size and any industry can benefit from DevOps
  - Shorter delivery cycles, decreased change failure rates, and improved performance
- DevOps has organizational and team-level impacts
  - Requires buy-in across entire organization and development teams
